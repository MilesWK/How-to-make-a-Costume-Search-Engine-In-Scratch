Hello! This little document is going to teach you how to make a Costume Search Engine in Scratch. 
What you need:  
  - A Scratch account
  - A knowlage of Scratch.

If you have all that... You are ready to go!!! 

Step 1: Make a new sprite:

You need to create a new sprite with a variety of random costumes. I would recomennd using the "surprise" button to do this. Do it about 10 times.

Once you have a fairly long list of totally random costumes, you are ready to move on to the next step.

Step 2: Getting all the random costumes into a list:

There are a couple of ways to do this:

One way is to make a new list, and just put a bunch of ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121042782/208459108-478739da-7c8b-439d-bd7d-650826cc9b2a.png) to the program.

The other way (the one we are going to use) is to make a program that finds all the costumes and adds them to the list. This allows us to add costumes to the sprite and still have the new costumes in the list... without changing the program.

To start, we are going to make a new My-Block called "Get Costumes" and a list called "Costumes." For the first line in the definition of the My-Block, we are going to delete all the items in the "Costumes" list:
